  "embedding_tooltip": "Embedding Model. When adding a knowledge base, you need to select an embedding model to vectorize knowledge base segments. When users ask questions, the questions will also be converted into vectors. By comparing vector similarity, knowledge base segments semantically similar to the question are matched. Vector retrieval has excellent semantic analysis capabilities.",
